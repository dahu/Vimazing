INTRODUCTION                                    *vimazing*

Vimazing is both very Vim and totally Amazing. It's, Vimazing! Other hjkl
trainers may have you doing boring, real-world things to practise the
essential movement keys in Vim, but not Vimazing. Our patented system will
quickly have you moving Vim style like you've been Vimming since the 70's.

GAME PLAY                                        *vimazing-gameplay*

Use your hjkl keys to navigate the maze. You will start at the top of the maze
on the X. Your goal is to move through the maze to the + at the bottom.  Be
careful, though! If you hit a wall or stumble into a trap, you will lose a
life and have to restart the maze from the beginning! But don't dawdle because
you're on the clock! If you don't finish the maze in time, it's lights out for
you, sunshine.

RANDOM MAZES ~

Vimazing generates a random maze for each level. The size of the maze is
determined by the level - bigger mazes for higher levels.

DANGERS ~

Various nasties lurk within the twisted halls of Vimazing. If you stumble into
one of these unwittingly, you may lose a life, lose time or end up in a
completely different part of the maze. Approach unknown objects in your path
with caution.

BONUSES ~

Various delights await your discovery in the winding halls of Vimazing.
Finding one of these will bestow upon you great rewards and enormous power,
like extra lives, more time and a cool reputation. Grab these opportunities
when you find them on your path.

CAUTION ~

Distinguishing Dangers from Bonuses is left as an exercise for the adventurous
player.

ISSUES                                          *vimazing-issues*

Some people may find this game so addictive that they forget to eat. Please,
set an alarm clock, or have a responsible adult supervise your Vimazing
sessions.

Cheating ~

Very little effort has been made to make Vimazing cheat-proof. Indeed,
learning to cheat is a -goal- in Vimazing.
If you start "jumping through walls" by using 3j , 3l , t# and such to make
your life easier then, congratulations, you've graduated from Vimazing! You
should now move on and start reading |motion.txt|. :)

If you start writing mappings like this: >
  map <F2> <space>/+<cr>
< ( space starts maze, /+<cr> makes cursor jump to the goal finishing the maze)
then find something else to do. Of course, you -could- see how amazing the
larger mazes look...

Safety First ~

* Not suitable for people over the age of Serious.
* Keep out of reach of malcontents.
